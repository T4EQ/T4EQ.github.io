As part of our mission, we are actively working on projects focused on rural development, starting with bridging the digital divide in education. These initiatives also aim to enhance local livelihoods and promote long-term community growth. Our ongoing projects are described below.

**Portable lighting for rural classrooms**

This project offers a portable, easy-to-assemble lighting solution for rural classrooms where electricity is limited or unreliable. 

**Offline video delivery system for remote classrooms** 

This project offers a solution to the challenge of accessing educational content in low-bandwidth rural areas, where slow internet disrupts teaching and reduces student engagement.

Please feel free to reach out for more information about the projects.
